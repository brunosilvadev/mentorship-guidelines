    <h1>Mentorship Guidelines</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>The utmost goal is to share knowledge and grow together</li>
        <li>The code product is secondary, but should be held to high standard</li>
        <li>Communication and collaboration are fundamental</li>
        <li>Documentation will be written in English, always</li>
        <li>Test-driven development should be a goal to be worked towards,
            not a starting requirement</li>
        <li>Readability is the biggest factor to weigh in coding decisions</li>
        <li>This list will continue to be updated</li>
    </ul>
